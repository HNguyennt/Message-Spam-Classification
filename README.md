SMS Spam Classification is a project aimed at tackling the issue of unwanted and unsolicited text messages, commonly referred to as "spam." With the widespread use of mobile phones and messaging services, the problem of spam messages has become a significant concern. These messages can be annoying, misleading, and potentially harmful to users. To address this challenge, machine learning techniques are employed to automatically identify and classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam).

The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a text classification model capable of distinguishing between legitimate messages and spam messages. By training on a labeled dataset of SMS messages, the model learns patterns and characteristics of spam content, allowing it to make accurate predictions on new, unseen messages.

In this project, we follow a step-by-step approach to accomplish the SMS Spam Classification task:

• Data Preprocessing: Prepare the raw SMS text data for analysis by cleaning, tokenizing, and transforming it into a suitable format for machine learning.
• Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the text data to represent the content effectively.
• Model Selection: Choose a suitable classification algorithm for the task, such as the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
• Training and Evaluation: Train the selected model on a labeled dataset and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
• Visualizing Results: Visualize the model's predictions and performance metrics to gain insights into its strengths and limitations.

By the end of this project, we aim to have a trained model that can effectively classify incoming SMS messages as spam or legitimate. This classification aids in providing users with a cleaner and safer messaging experience, filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful content.
